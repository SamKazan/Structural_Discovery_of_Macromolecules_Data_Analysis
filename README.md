# Structural_Discovery_of_Macromolecules_Data_Analysis

This work focuses on exploring the relationship between molecule type, experiment technique, the effect of residue count, and resolution in protein structure discovery. I used various machine learning techniques (K-means clustering, Hierarchical clustering, and DBSCAN) to analyze the data and reveal the underlying connections between crystallographic data and factors related to solving structures.
